# lyrionmusicserver-omnios

lyrionmusicserver for omnios
currently only lyrionmusicserver 9.1 (git from August 2025) with omnios r151046 and perl 5.36 is supported by the "lms" install script,
but you can run the "build-lms" script to get the current lyrionmusicserver version from git and compile against other perl versions by yourself (compiling can take some time)
