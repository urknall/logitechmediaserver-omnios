<h4>SB Radio and Logitech Media Server 8+</h4>

<p>Unfortunately the latest Squeezebox Radio firmware (7.7.3) comes with a bug which prevents it from connecting correctly
to Logitech Media Server 8+. It's version string comparison function fails to recognize 8.0.0 as more recent than 7.7.3.
While the bug has been fixed years ago, the fixed firmware never got released. Unfortunately we're at this point not
able to build a fixed firmware for distribution.</p>

<p>But there's a patch available, which you can easily install on an existing SB Radio:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On the Radio go to Settings/Advanced/Applet Installer, install the Patch Installer. The Radio will re-boot.</li>
	<li>Once it's back, go to Settings/Advanced/Patch Installer and install the "Version Comparison Fix".</li>
	<li>When done patching all Radios you might need to restart Logitech Media Server to make the warning go away.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy the music on your SB Radio!</p>
